          <h3>Our suggestions for writing</h3>

          <p>
            When you're writing, try to write as continuously as possible. You may have a thought in the middle, but keep the pen moving (or fingers on keyboard) through it all. Ten minutes is not a very long time 😉
          </p>

          <p>
            Using a timer (as opposed to just looking at the clock) is ideal.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may use the prompt as a "stem," repeating it over and over again to keep you going. If you are stuck, you may also write, "I'm not sure what to write here." In the tradition of Natalie Goldberg's 'free writes', we recommend not crossing things out, not editing as you create, and not necessarily planning out what you will write.
          </p>

          <p>
            Go with your first instinct. It's best to do the prompt as soon as you see it, or if you see the prompt at a time when you can't write, try not to let your mind linger on it during the day. Thinking is not writing. Writing is writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be as specific as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also encourage adapting or changing the prompt—you may change the pronouns or tense of the prompt (for instance, if it says, "You go to the store," you can write a prompt about, "He was going to the store last week when…") It's also fine to completely deviate from the prompt, and not write about it at all, or write about whatever it brings to mind. The prompt is a place to start, not a strict rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            This doesn't need to turn into anything. On the other hand, maybe it will turn into something. We recommend putting your writings away and not revisiting them for a few months. They'll look different to you three months from now and different again in a year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Try not to miss any days. If you happen to, it's fine. Just get back on the horse and write two responses the next day. Or, you can continue past "Day 18" by just doing one response per day until you've caught up on the ones you missed.
          </p>

          <p>
            You might like to keep each write in a separate file, or keep them all in one file—up to you! Whatever keeps you best organized.
          </p>

          <h3>Optional: Partnership</h3>

          <p>
            For the Cocoon edition (December 2025), we are offering a spreadsheet (like a carpool spreadsheet!) where you can optionally sign up for a partner to either receive feedback or for accountability. You'll receive access to the spreadsheet when you sign up for this edition. Here are some guidelines:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>If your partner sends you their response first, write yours first without reading theirs beforehand.</li>
            <li>Don't send more than 10 minutes worth of writing to your partner. The idea here is to put a limit on the amount of reading each person has to do.) DO write for the full 10 minutes, even if the end is just: And then, and then, and then nothing.</li>
            <li>Only positive feedback is allowed.</li>
            <li>Every day, each person sends back the other's prompt with ONLY positive feedback attached to it. We repeat because this is one of the coolest parts of the exercise. Feedback can be in comments/in line, and/or in a response paragraph/bullet points below the piece.</li>
            <li>Read the piece more than once. Once to experience it, and again to comment.</li>
            <li>Be generous with your feedback. Golden rule mega-applies here.</li>
            <li>Try to make it as specific as possible so the other person knows what affected you, what you got from the piece, what it made you think about. What sentences you really enjoyed, or which phrases, and why.</li>
            <li>Don't lie or be dishonest to find positive feedback. Giving positive feedback can be as much of a practice as doing the writing. Really look for what you like.</li>
            <li>Do not offer your personal advice about the content ("She sounds like an asshole–break up with her!") or respond to what might (or might not) be the writer's personal life.</li>
            <li>Having trouble giving positive feedback? You might talk about the energy of the piece, or what you liked about the topic choice, or what surprised you, or made you think. Or, get really specific: "I loved your second sentence here," or, "This part made me laugh." You can also just bold or put ***s around your favorite parts.</li>
            <li>When responding to your partner's piece, change the title to include your initials or some indicator. For instance: "mysistersaidCKcomments.doc."</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A note that applies to both feedback and writing: don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
